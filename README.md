# PersonalPortfolio
Portfolio build with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap



The challanges and solutions for this project are as follows:

    1. Challange:
        Make the portfolio simple, easy to use, and enjoyable to look at.
        Solutions: 
        -Single page but easy to navigate.  This was accomplished with the use of buttons that jump to specific content.  Buttons are transparant to avoid distracting form the content.
        -Clean, uncluttered design.
        -Present as much information visually as possible.  For example the links are icons as opposed to text.  Use of icons is also intended to tailor content to the target audience.  
    2. Challenge: 
        Make the portfolio engaging enough that it could potentailly result in more time spent looking at it, than competing portfolios.  Accomplish this without violating the above goals of simplicity, ease of use, and maintaining a clutter free experience.  
        Solutions:
        -Parallax:  The forground features surfaces and texutres as opposed to colors for richness and to contrast cookie-cuttter bootstrap or materialze aesthetics.  The backgound features vistas comprised of mataial similar to the surfaces for a unified design.  This also creates clear deliniation between sections.
        -Sublte hover effects:  This is a pleasant way of pointing out to users that the icons are interactive, as well as guiding the eye around the page. Tool tips reinforce the function of the design with 0 clutter.
        -Thematic choices:  Images were chosen for the following reasons;  The vistas provide a sense of expansiveness, while the surfaces evoke the details.  This theme is an anologue of my approach to application design.  I want to communicate that I want to build things out of details that make add up.  Details that accumulate into a whole greater than their sum, as cohesive, tightly unified experience.  This attention to detail is a strength of mine and I want to show it off.
    3. Challenge:
        Use the portfolio to provide an employer with a sense of my personality without taking any focus away from clearly presenting my skills and what I can do for them. 
        Solutions:  
        -Image choices: One of the things I love makes up the background images.  I chose a picture of myself that links the forground to the background.  They're also hopefully pleasant backgrounds to look at with universal appeal.
        -Distinction:  Using the design itself to convay the information is a major strength of mine that can use to help employers in a practical, tangible way.  I'm using the portfolio to show them as opposed to telling them.
    4. Challenge:
        Mobile responsive design, without losing desktop drama:
        Solutions:
        -Bootstrap gid layout:  Positions content in the right places for various screen sizes.  
        -Breakpoints:  Simple breakboint quirries help to smooth out any potential wrinkles in image sizing.
